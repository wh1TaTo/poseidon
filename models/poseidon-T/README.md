The Tiny model of the Poseidon family with approx. 21M parameters, see https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.19101.

It is trained on a computational grid of size 128 x 128 and expects density, velocity in horizontal direction, velocity in vertical direction, and pressure as inputs.

This is a **research model**.
